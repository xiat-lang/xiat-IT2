-- branch --
the following statement is a branch
`()` or `[]` or `{}`
thats techncally a branch, (however they are EMPTY branches)
current as per version (IT2) the following is a if statement (head and body)
`
    if (HEAD) {
        BODY
    } else {
        BODY
    }
` where HEAD is the condition, BODY is the code.
HEAD conditions can contain following upcodes:
(equal) `==` (not equal) `!=` (less) `<` (more) `>` and techncally (varptr, see more on varibles) `$`

-- varibles --
varibles has 2 ways: writing and reading

writing to varibles is the following:
=name value;
where name is varible name, value is the inputed value, if value is the semiclon itself, it will be '???' (basically NULL)

reading a varible is following:
$name (-> value) 
where name is varible name (you must delcare it first) and it returns the value of the varible (ence a var pointer)
