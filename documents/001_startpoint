-- 001: start point --

Hello! welcome to XIAT programming language, this is part 1 of the tutorial.
first of we must mention this programming language is very niche and not widly used
so compatibility is low.

-- testing the interpreter --
after this, run follwing command:
'python3 check.py'
should pass all test cases, if not, please report at https://github.com/xiat-lang/xiat-IT2/issues
then create a file (e.g shob can have file extensions: xiat, xi, xt, xia)

-- getting started --
first of download the interpreter (if you havent aredy) with should be name 'main.py'

hello world in xiat is very simillar in python:
`print("Hello, World!);` (hello mom is allowed btw)
just note semicolons are mandetory

-- documentation format --
as you can see this documentation is quite different, here what each format means:

between quotes ('') - command line
between (``) - source code
between par (()) - notes
between hiphons (-- text --) - headers / titles / sub titles

we are planning into make both web version and local versions of documentation, 1 by 1 exacly same
we see you soon on next part!
